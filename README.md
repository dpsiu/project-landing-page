# project-landing-page

This is the Landing Page project from TOP!

So far, starting this on 3/23, I have learned a lot. At a decently fast pace as well.
    I have learned HTML, gone through CSS, and will build the landing page independent of TOP's aid.

I know later projects will be more difficult, and i have to keep in mind how to stand
    out to recruiters to make it in this job market.
