# project-landing-page

This is the Landing Page project from TOP!

So far, starting this on 3/23, I have learned a lot. At a decently fast pace as well.
    I have learned HTML, gone through (although at times difficult) CSS,
    and will now build the landing page all by myself.

I know later projects will be more difficult, and i have to keep in mind how to stand
    out to recruiters to make it in this job market. I have to keep dialing back to
    "How does this help make me marketable, how do I stand out."
